If we have time
===============

- Before the JS fetches the data, the page below the title is blank (if time).
- When the user has "Submit" or "Cancel" selected and hits "Enter", it should submit or cancel.
- Bug: My profile picture only seems to load after I visit url myself.
- When the user hits "Enter" in the title field, it should go to the link/text field
- When the user hits "Enter" in the link field, it should submit.
- The profile colors seem off: light green is too saturated, red is too close to the "new post" button, who would use brown?
