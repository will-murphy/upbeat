Part Deux
- The profile colors seem off: light green is too saturated, red is too close to the "new post" button, who would use brown?
- Initial Contributors

- It fails when you put html in the title
- Make "View Comments" and "Delete Post" buttons more obvious--background color or hover

If we have time
===============

- When an initial contributor comments, their name doesn't show until you refresh.
- Before the JS fetches the data, the page below the title is blank (if time).
- When the user has "Submit" or "Cancel" selected and hits "Enter", it should submit or cancel.
- When the user hits "Enter" in the title field, it should go to the link/text field
- When the user hits "Enter" in the link field, it should submit.
